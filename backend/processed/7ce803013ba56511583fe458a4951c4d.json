The image consists of two main parts: a conceptual overview on the left and a technical diagram on the right. The left side presents a simple stepped progression (Data \u2192 Insight \u2192 Action) and explains that causal modeling provides probabilistic predictions and action recommendations. The right side shows a complex causal graph diagram representing an industrial process, with multiple interconnected nodes (like Catalyst_circulation, Fossil_feed, Bio_feed, etc.) connected by arrows with numerical values, demonstrating real-world application of causal modeling. The diagram appears to be from an academic paper, as indicated by the citation at the bottom. This image appears designed to explain both the theoretical benefits and practical applications of Causal AI in industrial processes.", "processed_at": "2025-08-16 14:00:27.377158", "embedding": null, "evaluation": {"confidence_score": 0.69, "quality_level": "Very Poor", "total_score": 69.5, "max_score": 100.0, "evaluations": [{"criteria": "Text Completeness", "score": 9, "max_score": 10, "percentage": 90.0, "reasoning": "Substantial text extracted (63 words)", "suggestions": []}, {"criteria": "Text Accuracy", "score": 8, "max_score": 10, "percentage": 80.0, "reasoning": "Text appears to be accurately extracted", "suggestions": []}, {"criteria": "Visual Element Coverage", "score": 2, "max_score": 10, "percentage": 20.0, "reasoning": "Limited visual elements described: images", "suggestions": ["Expand coverage of visual elements"]}, {"criteria": "Layout Description", "score": 10, "max_score": 10, "percentage": 100.0, "reasoning": "Good spatial and layout descriptions.
