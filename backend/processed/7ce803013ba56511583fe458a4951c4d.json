DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.2c01326", "visual_description": "This appears to be a presentation or educational slide explaining Causal AI technology. The image consists of two main parts: a conceptual overview on the left and a technical diagram on the right. The left side shows a simple stepped progression from 'Data' to 'Insight' to 'Action' in green blocks, along with key benefits of causal modeling. The right side displays a complex causal graph showing relationships between various industrial process variables, with numbered connections and arrows showing cause-effect relationships. The graph appears to be from an academic paper about industrial processes, with variables like catalyst circulation, feed temperature, and produced steam. The overall purpose seems to be explaining why and how Causal AI can be used in industrial applications, demonstrating both the conceptual benefits and a practical example through the technical diagram. The content appears aimed at technical audiences interested in industrial process optimization.", "processed_at": "2025-08-16 14:22:16.193165", "embedding": null, "evaluation": {"confidence_score": 0.67, "quality_level": "Very Poor", "total_score": 67.0, "max_score": 100.0, "evaluations": [{"criteria": "Text Completeness", "score": 9, "max_score": 10, "percentage": 90.0, "reasoning": "Substantial text extracted (70 words)", "suggestions": []}, {"criteria": "Text Accuracy", "score": 8, "max_score": 10, "percentage": 80.0, "reasoning": "Text appears to be accurately extracted", "suggestions": []}, {"criteria": "Visual Element Coverage", "score": 2, "max_score": 10, "percentage": 20.0, "reasoning": "Limited visual elements described: images", "suggestions": ["Expand coverage of visual elements"]}, {"criteria": "Layout Description", "score": 7, "max_score": 10, "percentage": 70.0, "reasoning": "Basic spatial relationships described.
